            <div class="mbr-text counter-container col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                <div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>The Do's and Donts of CV!
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><ol><li>Never start your CV with "Curriculum Vitae". Start with your name boldly written with a larger font.</li>
                    <li>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ensure the address on your CV is the same with the location of the job. It will make interviewers consider you faster. e.g, if the job is in Lagos, apply with a Lagos address. If you don't stay in the same location, look for someone you know that use same location. &nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Don't use childish email address. Use an email address with your name. Don't use email address such as . It says a lot about your maturity and professionalism. You can use michaeljacobs@gmail.com or michael.jacobs@gmail.com. If the name is already taken, add some numbers, e.g michaeljacobs236@gmail.com&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Under personal data or profile. Some entities like date of birth, state, local government and nationality are not compulsory. As a matter of fact, if the age they need doesn't favour you, just take off your date of birth. Keep the interviewer in doubt. Rather sell your skills.&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Under educational background and dates, simply write your school, your course of study and then the year you graduated. Take off the year you got admission. Some people started school in 2005 and graduated in 2012 for a 4-year course. It might not be their fault but employers wouldn't take it that way since you're not there to defend it. So I repeat, write out only graduation year.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Also, there's no need for your grade (First class, 2.1, 2.2, etc). Just take it off!</li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;Professional Certification is another area that's making people lose out of job search in recent times. Under this section, most people don't have what to put and it pisses off most employers. It means you haven't done much to add value to yourself. If you are a Corp member here, try to do one or two professional course during your service year, else you will be submitting what we call a blank CV'. For those working, you can use your weekends to achieve same. It will help you in your next job search.</span><br></li><li>Under your referees or references, please you are expected to have your referees name, address, phone number and email address. You can also use your family member as your referee but ensure you don't use the same surname. Also, ensure your referees are aware you are using them as referees to avoid stories that touch.
</li><li>
An ideal CV should be in black and white not coloured except on two occasions: if you are applying as a graphic designer and you want to wow your employer or when your CV has the logo of the company you've worked before under your job experience. &nbsp;</li><li>Never forward a CV from your inbox to another employer. Open and compose a fresh mail then upload your CV and send.&nbsp;<br></li><li>When sending your CV, make sure the subject carries the job role you are applying for.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Don't save your CV on your laptop or phone as 'My CV' or Edited CV'. Simple save it with your full name, e.g Samuel Eze.&nbsp;<br></li><li>
When sending your CV, don't leave the email page blank. Copy your cover letter and post on the email page. Forget the usual 'Sir, kindly find attached herewith for your .&nbsp;</li><li>
You don't need to append your passport photo on your CV except the employer request for it which is quite rare.</li>

</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>See example of a career objective 
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><em>Objective to be hired as an Assistant Manager position with an innovative employer in the manufacturing industry. Preferably, said position has opportunity for advancement with demonstrated excellence.
</em></div><div>
</div><div>In the above, the job seeker seeking for experience.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>For those who have experience or who are working class or you have worked before please stick to your <em>CAREER SUMMARY.</em>&nbsp;It helps not to spend too much time on your CV and it gives the HR at least 70% of your cv content 
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>See below for example 
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><em>Engaging Senior Customer Service Representative with 15+ years of experience in fast-paced call center environment. Skilled at transforming customer feedback into actionable insights that drive revenue, increase customer loyalty, and improve processes.
</em></div><div>
</div><div>Picking this CV up and seeing this, an interviewer knows what you have done and the experience you have in that role then it gives an idea that you are experienced all needed to do is to send you an email for an interview because you have met my criteria for that role.</div></div>

                <div><em><strong>A cover letter is a letter used in applying for a job position. It tells the employer your achievement(s) and how you can replicate same achievement in his firm if considered for the job. In fact, a cover letter allows you sell yourself to an employer, making them see what they stand to gain should you be employed. </strong></em></div><div><em><strong>The major idea behind cover letters is to enable you seduce your would-be boss to see you as the 

</strong></em><em><strong>best candidate. However, we have to be careful with our choice of words so we do not brag instead of selling our skills. We have three major&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>types of cover letters and they all play different roles:&nbsp;</strong></em></div><div><br></div><ul>
                    <li><strong>Speculative or cold calling cover letters
</strong></li><li><strong>Cover letters in response to job adverts&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Cover letters with names dropping.&nbsp;</strong><br></li><li><strong>Speculative or cold calling cover letters: </strong>Now, we send speculative or cold calling cover letters to firms we are not sure have vacancies but we want to work there. You send such 

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">cover letters and then send a follow-up letter three weeks later. The idea is to put yourself in the eyes of the employer. &nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Cover letters in response to job adverts: </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Cover letters in response to job adverts have taken over application letters. It is written to woo an employer that you are the right&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">candidate for the job. Here, you look at the skills they need the candidate to have and tell the employer you can do it. You also tell the e</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">mployer problems you've solved in the past. It could be when you made your students do well in WAEC during your Youth Service year or when </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">you made a good sales for your former/present firm. Even your social media skills can be brought in by telling your employer that you would&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">use it to project the firm to people.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>
</strong><strong>Cover letters with name dropping:</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Cover letters with name dropping is used when you are recommended by someone to a company. On the letter, you will need to state who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">recommended you and address the letter to the particular person you were told to write. It takes the form of speculative cover letter but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">only has names stated on it. So in a nutshell, cover letters are to make you sell your skills, so give the employer your best shot.</span></li>

                     <p class="p-3">The first line or two of your cover letter must convey the position you are applying for. This is also the place to start talking about y<span style="font-size: 1rem;">our education and related years of experience. Always try reviewing resume writing tips for whatever position you intend applying for.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Let the reader know that you are excited about applying for this opportunity and confident in your ability to be an asset to them</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Your&nbsp;introductory paragraph&nbsp;should be concise and to the point to make an excellent first impression.</span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>How HR's catch the thief:</em></strong></span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> When what is in your cover letter contradicts what is on your CV then they know you are telling a lie and won't invite you for an interview...integrity is key. Never ever write your cover letter without your CV close to you there must be an alignment so you don't say A and your letter is singing B.</span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you are genuinely attracted to the company’s brand or have used their products or services before, this is a great opportunity to say so.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Employers value authentic enthusiasm because it often translates to highly motivated and successful employees. e.g. I was excited to see&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">that Company ABC is hiring an event manager skilled at increasing brand awareness and driving growth with high-traffic events especially&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">since I’ve attended several of your company’s speaking events myself. With my 5+ years of experience coordinating successful events in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">corporate space, I'm confident I will be a great fit for the role.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Your intro should show enthusiasm that you are excited about the opening.</span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>Now let's take it bit by bit:</em></strong></span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">- If you truly want the job you are applying for, then act like it! Make sure that your writing comes across with conviction. If you do not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">believe in yourself and what you are expressing, then how can you think anyone else will? Be confident in yourself and let that shine&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">through in your cover letter. Let your words exude passion, enthusiasm, and excitement for this new opportunity you are seeking and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">committed to obtaining.</span></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">- Your cover letter should complement your resume. This means there needs to be uniformity between the two documents concerning&nbsp;formatting,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">style, font, borders, etc. They should both have the same overall layout. Furthermore, it demonstrates your keen eye for detail and the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">ability to remain consistent.</span></p><p class="p-3"><strong><em>Grammatical blunders:</em></strong></p><p class="p-3">- This is why many are not hired; when you make blunders in your letter, wrong use of tenses (present instead of past tense), bad&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">punctuation and also not proof reading to correct errors then you shoot your cover letter to the recruiter like dat. Be rest assured you are&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">solely responsible for not being invited due to inability to proof read and correct errors before sending.</span></p><p class="p-3">- Take accomplishments that are the most relevant from your resume and include them in your cover letter. They shouldn’t be worded the same;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">restructure them to flow with the application letter. If you have more than two, incorporate them into bullet points.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Briefly, explain how you executed these achievements.

<br>This question is meant to cage you to 'one corner'. I know you all know the song. 
<br>If you say 'yes', it means you can't be trusted. If you say 'no', it means you don't have the interest of the firm at heart. So what do you say? 
<br>Simply Tell them, 'As a professional, I will do anything within my powers to protect the interest of my company'. 'within my powers' is an open statement. That means if you can lie, you will. If you can't lie, you wouldn't.&nbsp;</p>

<br>This is a tricky one. Don't go self destructive by telling them,' I have two boyfriends sir, Emeka and Peter. In case, Emeka disappoints me'.
<br>They are not interested in your affairs. This is a 'perfunctory' question meant to probe your disposition. They want to know how sociable you are. So answer this way, Sir; I have many friends and if given the opportunity to work here, I will make sure they do business with this firm.</p>

<br>Tell me about a time when you performed well under enormous pressure.” 
<br>Step 1. Using the STAR method to answer this question, we’ll first start with describing the situation: 
<br>One time, at my last job, my coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished and without a manager. 
<br>Step 2. Next, we’ll give them the task: 
<br>My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks. 
<br>Step 3. Then the action taken to solve the problem: 
<br>I requested and was granted a reduction in my weekly goals, allotting me more time to attack the special project. As far as my weekly goals, I was able to delegate them out evenly to some of my teammates. 
<br>Step 4. And finally, the result of your actions: 
<br>With the reduction in my daily goals, I was able to dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise. 
<br>See that!! It might have been a long story for an answer, but following the STAR interview format will give you detailed responses the interviewer expects when asking a behavioral-based interview question. 
<br>And, it’s not too hard to do, either. As long as you work out each step in the STAR method in order, you’ll nail your answer and impress them while you’re at it.</p>

                    <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The STAR method</strong></h4>
                    <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The STAR method is a technique of answering behavioral interview questions in a structured manner by describing a specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are discussing. The STAR method helps you explain in a simple yet powerful way how you handled specific work situations and challenges. 
<br>  
<br>The STAR format stands for Situation, Task, Action and Result: 
<br>Situation: An event, project, or challenge faced. 
<br>Task: Your responsibilities and assignments for the situation. 
<br>Action: Steps or procedure taken to relieve or rectify situation. 
<br>Result: Results of actions taken. 
<br>  
<br>The STAR interview method is also called the CAR method, which stands for Context/Challenge, Action, Result. They’re essentially the same approach, with the Context of the CAR technique being equivalent to the Situation and Task of the STAR technique. It is synonymous, too, with the PAR method, which stands for Problem, Action, Result. &nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-date mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>How Would You Approach a Task You’ve Never Done Before?</strong><strong><br></strong> 
<br>Starting a new job often means of learning something newand also a period of adjustment for the employee. Your interviewer wants to assess whether you have problem-solving skills and whether you can approach new tasks intelligently.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Response like below is an idea on how this question can be tackled: 
<br>In my previous position as Project Support Officer, I was often challenged with new projects requiring me to step outside of my comfort zone. Therefore, I developed a systematic approach to each new challenge. For example, if the project was overwhelmingly large, I would first break it down into manageable steps. 
<br>I would undertake internet research and consultations with colleagues who had previous experience with the task. After I had completed each piece of work, I would always double-check it before handing it to my manager. 
<br>In the above!! 
<br>My method means my work is always presented to the best of my ability, even if it is something I have never done before.</p>

<br>
<br>- What you need to remember is that there are only two basic things employers want to discover about you. First are you a good fit for their culture. And second, how well do you respond to problems and manage change. 
<br>- They also want to know how well you're able to get along with others and work on teams. Are you good at resolving conflicts and dealing with difficult people? Are you a leader or a follower? Do you have the ability to influence your co-workers in a positive way to engender cooperation and increase productivity? Are you flexible and able to adapt to new or unexpected situation? 
<br>- Situation questions are often asked to evaluate how well you with handle stress. Can you turn crticism into something positive, or does it just make you depressed and less productive? Can you maintain your cool while dealing with demanding co-corkers or clients? 
<br>- Hiring managers are eager to verify that you can perform job responsibilities as well as your resume perports. Situational interviews are useful for testing a job candidates technical abilities, job knowledge, organizational and management skills, and salesmanship. They also help hiring managers test your problem solving abilities. 
<br>So in your one on one interview or Skype or zoom interview do not forget this.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hiring managers ask this question because they want to know if a candidate understands what their company is trying to accomplish. Hiring managers already know you’re going to research the company. Therefore, by asking this question, you’re able to explain what you truly think about the company. 
<br>Focus your answer on what you’ve learned about the mission and values of the organization. You should also incorporate your personal values into your answer and how they will help you bring success to the organization. &nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Share a story about the time when you first became interested in your career. It could be a story about your first internship or an experience that attracted you to this type of work.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">How important do you think it is to work collaboratively with other customer service representatives and teams across a company? 
<br>Providing exceptional customer service is a team effort that requires constant collaboration to build a strong, positive image of the company. This question will let you know if a candidate is willing to jump in and help their colleagues, and if they have the ability to relay customer feedback effectively to other departments. 
<br>
<br>What interviewers look for in an answer: 
<br>- Teamwork abilities. 
<br>- Communication skills. 
<br>- Desire to improve the company. 
<br>Teamwork is essential for success as a customer service rep. At my last job, I worked closely with a cohesive team. We regularly pooled our knowledge and resources to address tricky customer complaints and handle a large amount of incoming calls during peak times. I also collaborated cross-functionally by collecting customer feedback and communicating it to the product team.</p>
